# 🛍️ Zara Instore Visibility & Sales Analysis

Hello! I’m Syarief, and this project is my deep dive into how product placement inside Zara stores can make or break sales. As someone who loves blending analytics with real-world business questions, I set out to answer: *Does what you see, really sell?*



## ✨ Why I Built This

- I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of data, retail, and human behavior.
- This project let me explore how data-driven insights can empower smarter merchandising strategies.
- I wanted to push beyond theory—so I rolled up my sleeves, got hands-on with Python, and uncovered actionable recommendations for a global brand.



## 📈 What I Learned & Challenges I Tackled

- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned messy, real-world retail data—missing values, inconsistent formats, you name it!
- **EDA & Visualization:** Used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to spot trends and outliers that weren’t obvious at first glance.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Built regression models to quantify just how much visibility matters for sales.
- **Insight to Action:** Learned to translate numbers into business strategies that actually make sense for store managers.



## 🛠 Tools & Skills

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
- **pandas, numpy** — data manipulation
- **matplotlib, seaborn** — data visualization
- **scikit-learn** — modeling and analysis



## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Visibility Drives Sales:** The more visible a product, the better it sells—confirmed by data!
- **Correlation Uncovered:** Found a strong, positive relationship between in-store placement and sales volume.
- **Actionable Tips:** Summarized key recommendations to help retailers maximize revenue through smarter product placement.



## 🤝 Let’s Connect!

I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, or just a good conversation about data and retail. If you’re interested in what I’m building or want to discuss how data can drive business results, feel free to reach out!
